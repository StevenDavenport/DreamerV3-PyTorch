# DreamerV3: Model-Based Reinforcement Learning with Sparse Rewards

A clean, well-documented implementation of **DreamerV3** optimized for sparse reward environments. This implementation includes all key upgrades from the DreamerV3 paper that specifically address the reward prediction bottleneck in imagination-based RL.

## 🌟 Key Features

### DreamerV3 Upgrades Implemented
1. **Symlog Transformation + Two-Hot Encoding** - Handles extreme reward imbalances (1000:1 ratios)
2. **Percentile-Based Return Normalization** - Robust handling of sparse rewards and outliers  
3. **Free Bits Mechanism** - Prevents KL posterior collapse (maintains minimum 1.0 nat)
4. **KL Balancing** - Stable world model learning with balanced gradients

### Additional Features
- ✅ **Smart Checkpointing** - Automatic saving of best models with descriptive names
- ✅ **Early Stopping** - Prevents overfitting with configurable patience
- ✅ **Comprehensive Logging** - WandB integration + local progress tracking
- ✅ **Validated Implementation** - All upgrades tested and proven to work

## 🧠 Technical Details

### The Sparse Reward Problem
In sparse reward environments, standard Dreamer fails because:
- Reward prediction learns to predict the most common reward (-0.001 step penalty)
- Success rewards are 1000x rarer and get ignored
- Imagination-based training collapses to 0% success

### DreamerV3 Solutions
1. **Symlog + Two-Hot**: Compresses reward scale and distributes probability
2. **Return Normalization**: Handles sparse returns and outliers robustly  
3. **Free Bits**: Prevents world model posterior collapse
4. **KL Balancing**: Stable training with balanced loss terms

### Validation Results
The `test_dreamer_v3_upgrades.py` script proves each upgrade works:
- Symlog handles 1000:1 reward imbalance compression
- Two-hot distributes probability vs one-hot concentration
- Return normalization manages sparse rewards effectively
- Free bits maintains minimum KL divergence threshold

## 🎯 Use Cases

Perfect for research in:
- **Sparse reward RL** (robotics, games, navigation)
- **Long-horizon tasks** (planning, strategy games)
- **Model-based RL** (sample efficiency, world models)
- **Imagination-based learning** (planning in latent space)

## 📊 Monitoring

All training scripts include:
- **WandB logging** - Real-time metrics and visualizations
- **Local progress files** - Detailed training logs
- **Automatic model saving** - Best models with performance metadata
- **Early stopping** - Configurable patience for optimal training time

## 🤝 Contributing
